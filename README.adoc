# About

roViz is a viewer for http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects] written in ActionScript (http://flex.apache.org/[Apache Flex]), 
ie. a generic client for applications that implement the Restful Objects Specification. 
An https://isis.apache.org/[Apache Isis] application with the restful objects interface enabled 
(https://github.com/apache/isis/tree/master/example/application/simpleapp[SimpleApp], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[ToDoApp] , etc.) can be used for the server part. 

A http://nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtml[Naked Objects for .NET] application should work as well, but is not tested yet.

## How does it look like?
TIP: After selecting one of the preconfigured applications, the menu gets populated. Actions, here: listAll can be selected and a Tab with a table is displayed:

TIP: Clicking on the StatusBar at the bottom will create another tab showing logged XmlHttpRequests:

TIP: Remote applications here http://semat.ofbizian.com/[SEMAT] can be used as well, and even mixed with local apps.

## Bugs
CAUTION: Newly created Tabs are not focused

CAUTION: Menu items (Actions) are not ordered (yet)

CAUTION: LogEntries are not updated automatically (yet)

## TODO's for the PoC
* Parse *.layout.xml 
* Implement PUT, POST, DELETE as well
* Load and render single object 
* Transpile to Javascript using https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/FlexJS[FlexJS]
* Implement Filtered Table  

## Out of Scope for the POC
* measure code coverage
* 'collapse' tabs into top/left/right/bootom area / dock
* drag & drop (eg. tab to dock)
* Visualizing Geolocations like in Google Maps, see: 
** https://cohaesus.co.uk/finding-a-new-way-six-alternatives-to-google-maps/
** http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_2
* Use Cairngorm FW to decouple data loading from rendering: http://svn.code.sf.net/adobe/cairngorm/code/
* scale svg's: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5388290/how-to-display-svg-in-flex/5388543#5388543
* FlatSpark skins: do not support Menubar icons right now, see: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlatSpark+skins
* use SQL lite as store for url/credentials
* visualize 

## Tool Chain
* Apache Flex 1.16.1 
* IntelliJ 2017.3 (Ultimate)
* Moz://a FireFox 52 ESR
* Adobe FlashDebugger 27
* Windows 7

### GotChas
* Apache Flex could not be installed with the installer due to a firewall issue. Workaround: manual download and unzip.
* Browser (FF) was only showing a white page, browser debugger indicated: "ReferencError: swfobject is not defined"
In order for index.template.html to open the application, swfobject.js had to be placed in /html-template
